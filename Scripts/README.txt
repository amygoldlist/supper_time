Scripts, 

Read Me

So my mother has a very specific Word template that she uses to store recipes.  She's been doing this for years, and the data is stored as ".doc" instead of ".docx.

Once this is complete, the R script is going to read in the entire folder of recipes, keeping in the name of the folder as a tag (I hope).  Then I can just save that as a JSON file, and pull it into Python to select a recipe.

Unfortunantely, my mother did not tag a "time" heading on her recipes, but I think I can just add this.  

So there it is.
